# Start Next Issue

Select the next issue to work on from a PRD breakdown, confirm it with the user, and begin the discussion before implementation.

## Process

### 1. Determine the next issue

- Review the list of open issues from the PRD breakdown.  
- Suggest the next issue in order (backend-first, then frontend linked to completed backend).  
- Highlight any dependencies (for frontend issues, reference the related backend issue).

### 2. Confirm with the user

Present the suggested issue with:

- **Title**  
- **Issue number**  
- **Type** (backend / frontend)  
- **Blocked by** (if any)  
- **Related backend issue** (for frontend)  
- **Summary of what the issue builds**

Ask the user:

- Does this issue make sense to start now?  
- Do you agree with the suggested order?  

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### 3. Initiate discussion

Once confirmed, start a structured pre-implementation discussion:

1. **Objective:** Confirm the expected outcome of the issue.  
2. **Backend:** Discuss endpoints, schema, architecture, tools, or libraries.  
3. **Frontend:** Discuss layout, components, interactions, and libraries (if applicable).  
4. **Important decisions / trade-offs:** Any critical design choices or limitations.  
5. **Questions / uncertainties:** Open points to clarify before coding.  

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until you reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer. Ensure all points are clarified and the user approves the plan.

### 4. Mark issue as ready

- Once discussion is complete, mark the issue as ready to start coding.  
- For frontend issues, ensure the related backend issue is completed or reference it.  

No coding begins until this step is fully completed and agreed upon.
